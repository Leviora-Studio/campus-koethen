/**
 * Representative data volumes for the performance baseline.
 *
 * These numbers are the measurement contract: a baseline is only comparable to
 * a later measurement if both ran against the same profile. Every value is
 * derived from something observable in the repository — a configuration
 * ceiling, a sync cadence or a documented catalogue size — and the derivation
 * is written down next to it, so a reader can challenge the number instead of
 * trusting it.
 *
 * `realistic` is what the service is expected to hold in normal operation and
 * is the profile every published baseline uses.
 *
 * `stress` is the upper bound the configured guardrails still permit. It exists
 * to show how a hot path degrades as data grows, not to set a budget.
