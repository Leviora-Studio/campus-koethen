/// * A timed event with an end disappears exactly when `eventEnd <= now`
///   (minute-exact, since [DateTime] comparisons are instant-based).
/// * A timed event without an end stays visible until local midnight of its
///   start day — no duration is ever invented for it.
/// * An all-day event disappears at local midnight after its exclusive last
///   day (reusing [calendarDayOf], the same day-boundary rule the calendar
///   already uses, so the two never disagree about what "day" means).
